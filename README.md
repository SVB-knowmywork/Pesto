## Introduction

With Bookshelf, consumers do not need to blindly go to various places to find required books, they just simply go to Bookshelf and find it. Users can view its details, place an order, and then the book is delivered to their address. Users can see their orders placed, their status (delivered or not), and rate/review their ordered products.

-Live demo [_here_]().

Frontend and Backend are hosted on Netlify.
